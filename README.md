# CodeHs
This repository contains code that is used in the CodeHS Python course. It features various projects and exercises that reinforce the concepts taught throughout the course.

## Description
The code in this repository is organized as follows:
- File: main.py
  - Purpose: This file provides a user-friendly interface to run different Python files in the current directory. It allows the user to select a specific file to execute and rerun the code in case of an error. The code uses the `subprocess` module to run the selected file.

- File: test.py
  - Purpose: This file demonstrates the usage of the `colorama` module. It imports the `Back` and `Style` classes from the `colorama` module and showcases various text formatting options like changing the background color of the text and making the text appear dim. It also demonstrates how to reset the text to its default settings using the `RESET_ALL` attribute.

- File: Restaurant Bill Calculator.py
  - Purpose: This file contains a Python program to calculate the total bill amount and amount per person for a restaurant bill. It prompts the user to enter the total amount on the bill, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. It then calculates the tip amount, the total bill including the tip, and the amount each person needs to pay.

- File: Paint Calculator.py
  - Purpose: This file contains a Python program to calculate the amount of paint needed to paint a room. It prompts the user to enter the dimensions of the room (`length`, `width`, and `height`) and calculates the total area to be painted. It also takes into account the number of coats of paint needed and the coverage area per liter of paint. Finally, it calculates the total amount of paint required in liters.
